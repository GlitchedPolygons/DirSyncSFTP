# DirSyncSFTP

## Convert a folder on your Windows system into a dropbox. Kinda.

Windows Explorer integration for SFTP directories. Raw and simple. GPL-3.0 license. Enjoy.

This is a WPF application that can run in the background and synchronize one or more directories on your system with a remote SFTP server's directory.

It behaves kinda like dropbox, except it doesn't handle conflicts at all (the newest writer wins).

Makes use of [WinSCP](https://github.com/winscp/winscp) and its PowerShell interface for contacting the server and synchronizing.
